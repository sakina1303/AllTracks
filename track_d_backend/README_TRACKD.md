# Track D: Liveness Detection System

**Comprehensive anti-spoofing solution for contactless fingerprint capture**

---

## 🎯 Overview

Track D implements advanced liveness detection to prevent spoofing attacks in biometric systems. The system uses multiple detection methods to identify fake presentations.

### Detected Attack Types
- ✅ **Photo Attack** - Printed fingerprint photos
- ✅ **Screen Attack** - Phone/tablet displays
- ✅ **Video Replay** - Recorded video playback
- ✅ **Fake Finger** - Silicone/rubber replicas

---

## 🔬 Detection Methods

### 1. Motion-Based Detection (35% weight)
- Analyzes natural hand tremor
- Real fingers show micro-movements
- Photos/screens are completely static

### 2. Texture Analysis (25% weight)
- Detects print patterns and screen pixels
- Real skin has complex, irregular texture
- Fake presentations have regular patterns

### 3. Consistency Check (15% weight)
- Tracks frame-to-frame changes
- Detects video loops and sudden jumps
- Real conditions are smooth and consistent

### 4. Edge Density Analysis (10% weight)
- Measures edge characteristics
- Real skin has moderate edge density
- Fake fingers have abnormal edge patterns

### 5. Color Variance Analysis (10% weight)
- Analyzes RGB channel distribution
- Screens have uniform backlight
- Real skin has natural color variation

### 6. Pattern Detection (5% weight)
- FFT-based regular pattern detection
- Identifies print dot matrix patterns
- Detects screen pixel grids

## 📊 How It Works

### Analysis Flow

```
Frame Input
    ↓
Buffer Frames (10 frames)
    ↓
Analyze Motion (frame differencing)
    ↓
Analyze Texture (variance, edges)
    ↓
Check Consistency (brightness tracking)
    ↓
Analyze Edge Density (Canny)
    ↓
Analyze Color Variance (RGB channels)
    ↓
Detect Patterns (FFT)
    ↓
Combine Scores (weighted average)
    ↓
Detect Specific Attacks
    ↓
Final Decision: LIVE or SPOOF
```

### Scoring

**Overall Score Formula:**
```
Overall = (Motion × 0.35) + (Texture × 0.25) + (Consistency × 0.15) +
          (Edge × 0.10) + (Color × 0.10) + (Pattern × 0.05)
```

**Decision Threshold:**
- Score ≥ 60% → **LIVE** ✅
- Score < 60% → **SPOOF** ❌

## ⚙️ Configuration

All parameters are in `config.py`:

### Motion Detection
```python
MOTION_FRAMES = 10                # Frames to analyze
MOTION_THRESHOLD_MIN = 500        # Minimum motion
MOTION_THRESHOLD_OPTIMAL = 2000   # Optimal motion
```

### Scoring Weights
```python
WEIGHTS = {
    'motion': 0.35,
    'texture': 0.25,
    'consistency': 0.15,
    'edge_density': 0.10,
    'color_variance': 0.10,
    'pattern_detection': 0.05
}
```

### Decision Threshold
```python
LIVENESS_THRESHOLD = 0.60  # 60% minimum to pass
```

You can adjust these to tune sensitivity!

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Scenarios

1. **Real Finger** (Should PASS)
   - Hold finger 15-25cm from camera
   - Natural slight movement
   - Result: LIVE ✅

2. **Printed Photo** (Should FAIL)
   - Print fingerprint on paper
   - Hold to camera
   - Result: SPOOF ❌ (Photo Attack)

3. **Phone Screen** (Should FAIL)
   - Display fingerprint on phone
   - Show to camera
   - Result: SPOOF ❌ (Screen Attack)

4. **Video Playback** (Should FAIL)
   - Play recorded finger video
   - Show to camera
   - Result: SPOOF ❌ (Video Replay)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Camera not opening
**Solution:**
- Check if camera is connected
- Close other apps using camera
- Grant camera permissions

### Issue: Always detects SPOOF
**Solution:**
- Ensure good lighting
- Move finger slightly (natural tremor)
- Check if too close/far from camera

### Issue: Always detects LIVE (including fakes)
**Solution:**
- Lower threshold in config.py:
  ```python
  LIVENESS_THRESHOLD = 0.70  # Increase to 70%
  ```

## 🚀 Integration with Track A

To combine with Track A:

```python
# In main demo
from liveness_detector import LivenessDetector
from quality_analyzer import QualityAnalyzer

quality = QualityAnalyzer()
liveness = LivenessDetector()

# Analyze frame
quality_result = quality.analyze(finger_roi)
liveness_result = liveness.analyze_frame(frame)

# Both must pass
can_capture = (quality_result['score'] >= 70) and liveness_result['is_live']
```
