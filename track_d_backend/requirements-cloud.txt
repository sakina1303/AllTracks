# Track D - Cloud Deployment Requirements
# For GCP VM without physical camera (frontend camera version)

# Core dependencies
opencv-python-headless==4.8.1.78  # Computer vision (no GUI, smaller)
numpy==1.24.3                      # Numerical operations
mediapipe==0.10.9                  # Hand/finger detection
websockets==12.0                   # WebSocket server/client for API

# Note: Using opencv-python-headless instead of opencv-python
# because cloud VMs don't need GUI support and it's much smaller
